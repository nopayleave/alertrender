# QStoch Column Fix Summary

## The Problem

Your TradingView logs showed webhooks were being received, but the dashboard table wasn't updating with QStoch data. The issue was:

1. **Duplicate Alert Entries**: When D4 alerts came in, they created NEW alert entries in the array
2. **Wrong Alert Returned**: The `/alerts` endpoint returns the LATEST alert per symbol, so if a D4 alert came AFTER a List alert, it would return the D4-only alert (which had no price, vwap, etc.)
3. **Incomplete Data**: The dashboard would show "-" because it was getting the wrong alert entry

## The Fix

### Changed Alert Processing Logic:

**Before:**
- D4 alerts would call `updateAlertData()` â†’ creates new alert entry
- List alerts would create new alert entry
- Result: Multiple entries for same symbol, causing confusion

**After:**
- **D4, Quad Stoch D1/D2, VWAP Crossing alerts**: 
  - Store data in their respective storage objects (`quadStochD4Data`, `quadStochData`, `vwapCrossingData`)
  - If a main alert exists for that symbol, update it in-place
  - DON'T create new alert entries
  
- **Main List script alerts**:
  - Merge data from all storage objects
  - Create new alert entry with complete data

### Added Enhanced Logging:

You'll now see detailed logs like:
```
ðŸ“¨ Webhook received: { ... }
ðŸ“Š Alert type detected: { ... }
âœ… D4 signal stored for ADAUSD: D4_Downtrend
âœ… Updated existing alert for ADAUSD with D4 signal
âœ… Merged D4 signal for BTCUSD: D4_Cross_Down_50 (age: 0.5 min)
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Start it again to load the new code
node index.js
```

### Step 2: Update Your Quad Stochastic Script in TradingView

Make sure your "Quad Stochastic" script has the updated webhook code (lines 223-229):

```pinescript
// === Trigger webhook alert ===
// Create JSON alert message with symbol for webhook
if signal != ""
    jsonMsg = '{' +
      '"symbol": "' + syminfo.ticker + '",' +
      '"d4Signal": "' + signal + '"}'
    alert(jsonMsg, freq=alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
```

This ensures the D4 alerts include the symbol name.

### Step 3: Check Server Logs

When alerts fire, you should see in your server terminal:

```
ðŸ“¨ Webhook received: {
  "symbol": "ADAUSD",
  "timeframe": "3",
  "price": 0.85,
  ...
}
ðŸ“Š Alert type detected: {
  isDayChangeAlert: false,
  isVwapCrossingAlert: false,
  isQuadStochAlert: false,
  isQuadStochD4Alert: false,
  symbol: 'ADAUSD'
}

ðŸ“¨ Webhook received: {
  "symbol": "ADAUSD",
  "d4Signal": "D4_Downtrend"
}
ðŸ“Š Alert type detected: {
  isDayChangeAlert: false,
  isVwapCrossingAlert: false,
  isQuadStochAlert: false,
  isQuadStochD4Alert: true,
  symbol: 'ADAUSD'
}
âœ… D4 signal stored for ADAUSD: D4_Downtrend
âœ… Updated existing alert for ADAUSD with D4 signal
```

### Step 4: Check Dashboard

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and look for the **QStoch** column. You should see:

| Symbol | QStoch |
|--------|--------|
| ADAUSD | â†“ Downtrend |
| BTCUSD | â†‘âš¡ Bull>50 |
| ETHUSD | â†“âš¡ In OS |

### Step 5: Debug Endpoint (if needed)

Visit `http://localhost:3000/debug` to see:
- How many alerts are stored
- What D4 data is stored
- The latest 5 alerts

```json
{
  "alertsCount": 150,
  "historyCount": 200,
  "latestAlerts": [ ... ],
  "quadStochD4Data": {
    "ADAUSD": {
      "signal": "D4_Downtrend",
      "timestamp": 1760996740575
    },
    "BTCUSD": {
      "signal": "D4_Cross_Down_50",
      "timestamp": 1760996741000
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### Scenario 1: List Alert First, Then D4 Alert
1. List alert for AAPL comes in â†’ Creates alert entry with full data
2. D4 alert for AAPL comes in â†’ Updates existing AAPL alert with D4 signal
3. Dashboard shows AAPL with QStoch data âœ…

### Scenario 2: D4 Alert First, Then List Alert
1. D4 alert for AAPL comes in â†’ Stores in `quadStochD4Data`
2. List alert for AAPL comes in â†’ Creates alert entry, merges D4 data
3. Dashboard shows AAPL with QStoch data âœ…

### Scenario 3: Only D4 Alert (No List Alert)
1. D4 alert for AAPL comes in â†’ Stores in `quadStochD4Data`
2. No List alert exists yet â†’ No alert entry created
3. Dashboard doesn't show AAPL (expected - need List alert for full data)

### Scenario 4: Multiple Alerts Over Time
1. List alert for AAPL at 10:00 AM
2. D4 alert for AAPL at 10:05 AM â†’ Updates existing alert
3. List alert for AAPL at 10:10 AM â†’ Creates new alert, merges stored D4 data
4. Dashboard shows latest AAPL alert with most recent D4 signal âœ…

## QStoch Column Display Values

| Signal | Display | Color | Meaning |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| `D4_Uptrend` | â†‘ Uptrend | Green | D4 in uptrend |
| `D4_Cross_Up_80` | â†‘âš¡ Exit OB | Green (pulse) | Crossed up 80 |
| `D4_Cross_Up_50` | â†‘âš¡ Bull>50 | Green (pulse) | Crossed up 50 (bullish) |
| `D4_Cross_Up_20` | â†‘âš¡ Exit OS | Lime (pulse) | Crossed up 20 (exiting oversold) |
| `D4_Downtrend` | â†“ Downtrend | Red | D4 in downtrend |
| `D4_Cross_Down_20` | â†“âš¡ In OS | Red (pulse) | Crossed down 20 (oversold) |
| `D4_Cross_Down_50` | â†“âš¡ Bear<50 | Red (pulse) | Crossed down 50 (bearish) |
| `D4_Cross_Down_80` | â†“âš¡ In OB | Orange (pulse) | Crossed down 80 (overbought) |
| No signal | - | Gray | No recent D4 signal |

## Signal Expiration

- D4 signals expire after **30 minutes** of inactivity
- When expired, the QStoch column will show "-"
- This prevents stale signals from showing on the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### QStoch column still shows "-"

1. **Check server logs**: Are D4 alerts being received?
2. **Check symbol name**: Does the D4 alert have the correct symbol field?
3. **Check timing**: Is the List alert being sent for that symbol?
4. **Check age**: Is the D4 signal older than 30 minutes?

### Server logs show "fetch failed"

- Server is not running
- Server is on a different port
- Check with: `lsof -ti:3000` (should show a process ID)

### Dashboard not updating

- Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console)
- Verify the dashboard is polling: `http://localhost:3000/alerts`
- Clear browser cache and refresh
